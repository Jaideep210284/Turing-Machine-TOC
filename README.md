# Turing Machine Simulator
This project is a Python implementation of a Turing Machine simulator that can simulate the execution of Turing Machines based on user-defined configurations. The Turing Machine can read a tape, perform transitions, and provide visual feedback at each step of the computation.

# Introduction
A Turing Machine is a theoretical computing device invented by Alan Turing, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The Turing Machine simulator implemented here allows for the simulation of various Turing Machine configurations, helping users understand the workings of these fundamental computational models.

# Features
Customizable Turing Machines: Define initial states, final states, and transition functions.
Step-by-Step Visualization: Visual feedback of the tape and head position at each step.
Automated Execution: Option to run the Turing Machine automatically with a delay.
Universal Turing Machine (UTM): Load and execute multiple Turing Machines dynamically.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x

# Code Explanation
Turing Machine Class
Initialization: Initializes the Turing Machine with a tape, blank symbol, initial state, final states, transition function, and step counter.
Step Function: Executes one step of the Turing Machine based on the transition function.
Visualization: Displays the current state of the tape and head position.
Run Function: Runs the Turing Machine either step-by-step or automatically until it reaches a final state or halts.
Universal Turing Machine Class
Load Turing Machine: Loads a Turing Machine configuration.
Run Turing Machine: Runs the loaded Turing Machine on a given input string.
# Main Function
Define Turing Machine: Specifies the Turing Machine's states, transitions, and final states.
Input Handling: Accepts and validates user input.
Run Simulation: Executes the Turing Machine simulation and displays the result.
